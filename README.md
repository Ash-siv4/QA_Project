## INVENTORY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
This project contains an inventory management system which allows a user access to a database that contains customers, items and orders.

Simply put, the user can:
- create a new customer, item or order record and add it to the database,
- read all customers, items and orders currently in the database,
- update customer, item  or order details of existing data in the database,

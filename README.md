## INVENTORY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
This project contains an inventory management system which allows a user access to a database that contains customers, items and orders.
The user can oversee the database and control the data in the system.
Simply put, the user can:
- create a new customer, item or order record and add it to the database,
- read all customers, items and orders currently in the database,
- update customer, item  or order details of existing data in the database, 
- delete a customer or item from the system and be able to delete an entire order or just one item from an order containing multiple items.
The application is designed to be accessible via a command line interface(CLI).
